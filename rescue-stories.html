            <p class="story-text">This is Cooper, Cooper was a Rottweiler x Labrador and the most gentle giant. Cooper was around nine weeks old when he was rescued. 
            He came from an unwanted litter of puppies, sadly not all of the puppies survived but Cooper was one of the lucky ones. A neighbour
            of the then owner, found out what had happened to the rest of the litter and convinced the owner to surrender the remaining pups to 
            the rescue centre that she worked at. Thankfully, he agreed and Cooper was quickly adopted. His rough start to life never affected him,
            he loved people, other dogs - and cats! As you can see from his photo. He lived a long, happy life and actually went on to have puppies
            of his own, with Lulu! Her story is below...

            <p class="story-text"> Lulu was between nine and twelve months when she was rescued. Lulu was abandoned outside of a rescue centre and we grew to believe it 
            was due to her being a failed gun dog. Lulu was a Pointer cross - we were never sure what she was crossed with however. She failed 
            as a gun dog due to the fact she would retrieve things but then not drop them. Due to this downfall her owners abused her terribly. 
            Lulu was extremely nervous when she was adopted, she didn't like attention or to be touched, she wouldn't wear a collar or walk through doors, 
            she hated dark spaces but as time went on, she grew to trust humans again and ended up being the most loving dog.

            <p class="story-text"> Simba the Staffie, who truly fulfils the meaning of "Mans Best Friend". Simba was around nine weeks when he was surrendered to a rescue 
            centre. He was a small pup and because of his breed, had he have fallen into the wrong hands he could have led a very different life. 
            A lot of rescue centres will have Staffies, I'm not sure if it is due to misconceptions about the breed but these dogs are some of the most 
            incredible. Simba absolutely loves food, you can pretty much make him do anything for a biscuit! He also loves cats, and chickens. I'll often
            find him asleep under a duvet, he loves his warmth and comfort.

            <p class="story-text">Adopt Don't Shop, is not only about rescuing dogs but cats too. This is Cat, yes just Cat (like Breakfast In Tiffanys!). He arrived one 
            morning at an apartment window in Dublin, full of fleas, dirty and hungry. The people renting the apartment fed him, treated him for fleas 
            and thought he would be on his way. It seems in this instance however, he adopted his owners. He climbed in the window and never really left
            again. He's an older cat so doesn't do much but sleep, eat and go outside for an hour or so. Throughout Ireland there are countless adult cats
            just waiting for a lovely home. Cats are great, they are very independent, make great indoor pets and they're extremely clean!

            <p class="story-text"> This is Daisy, she was a stray for around a year. People saw her about but could never get close enough to help her. Fortunately someone
            rang Galway SPCA and they were able to catch her and take her to safety. It isn't clear how she ended up without a home and no one is quite sure of 
            her history. She turned out to be quite nervous around other dogs but absolutely brilliant with children. She loves her comforts, which after her rough start 
            isn't a surprise!

            <p class="story-text"> These two are Bob and Dylan, a pair of brothers found in a cardboard box. They were part of a litter of 7 and all kittens were rehomed, 
            these two were inseperable however so luckily they were able to find a home together! They love playing outside but not for too long, you're more likely to find
            them curled up asleep somewhere. Kittens are often found dumped in cardboard boxes or even plastic bags, some are found and others sadly are not. These two don't 
            seem to remember their rough start and they're both extremely loving.
