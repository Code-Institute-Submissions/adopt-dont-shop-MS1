            This is Cooper, Cooper was a Rottweiler x Labrador and the most gentle giant. Cooper was around nine weeks old when he was rescued. 
            He came from an unwanted litter of puppies, sadly not all of the puppies survived but Cooper was one of the lucky ones. A neighbour
            of the then owner, found out what had happened to the rest of the litter and convinced the owner to surrender the remaining pups to 
            the rescue centre that she worked at. Thankfully, he agreed and Cooper was quickly adopted. His rough start to life never affected him,
            he loved people, other dogs - and cats! As you can see from his photo. He lived a long, happy life and actually went on to have puppies
            of his own, with Lulu! Her story is below...

            Lulu was between nine and twelve months when she was rescued. Lulu was abandoned outside of a rescue centre and we grew to believe it 
            was due to her being a failed gun dog. Lulu was a Pointer cross - we were never sure what she was crossed with however. She failed 
            as a gun dog due to the fact she would retrieve things but then not drop them. Due to this downfall her owners abused her terribly. 
            Lulu was extremely nervous when she was adopted, she didn't like attention or to be touched, she wouldn't wear a collar or walk through doors, 
            she hated dark spaces but as time went on, she grew to trust humans again and ended up being the most loving dog.
