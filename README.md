# Adopt Don't Shop 

The aim of this project is to encourage people to rescue animals, in particular dogs. The project will showcase
stores of rescue animals and the benefits of rescue. The campaign will highlight the problems that can occur when
purchasing dogs from unregulated breeders. There will be a page containing information about where people in Ireland go can to 
rescue a dog or support charities.

4. As a user I want to understand what the websites purpose is immediately. 
5. As a user I want to read stories from others who have rescued, to see if it is for me.

### Site Owner

## Feautures 

## Technologies Used 

### Languages Used 

* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* Bootstrap v4.5

## Resources 

* YouTube - general resource and specifically for Nav Bar implementation as commented in code. 
* https://www.w3schools.com/ - general reference 
* https://getbootstrap.com/ - documentation for different features. 

## Testing

* Once I had implemented my Nav Bar and Home Page image, I viewed this using Google Chrome Developer Tools to see how the image and nav bar 
appeared on different device sizes. I then physically checked this on an Iphone 8, Iphone 8 Plus, Ipad Pro 11" and a Macbook Air 13".
* In my Wireframes you'll see I initally had a different layout planned for the Home Page, however on inserting content and viewing on multiple
devices I decided to change the grid layout. I again viewed on the above devices and used Google Chrome Developer Tools. 


## Project Barriers And Solutions 

* I ran into issues almost immediately with creating a responsive image on the home page that would work across different devices and wouldn't
contain too much white space. In the end using "img-fluid" gave the best response, I will be reviewing again to see if it can be improved further.

* I implemented a hamburger menu that upon clicking a link within, it would not collapse. I found a solution on Stack Overflow which is credited in my code, 
the solution used is found at this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked.
