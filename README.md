# Adopt Don't Shop 

The aim of this project is to encourage people to rescue animals, in particular dogs. The project will showcase
stores of rescue animals and the benefits of rescue. The campaign will highlight the problems that can occur when
purchasing dogs from unregulated breeders. There will be a page containing information about where people in Ireland go can to 
rescue a dog or support charities.
