# Adopt Don't Shop 

![Am I Responsive Img](assets/images/am-i-responsive-2.png)

The aim of this project is to encourage people to rescue animals, in particular dogs. The project will showcase
stories of rescue animals and the benefits of rescue. The campaign will highlight the problems that can occur when
purchasing dogs from unregulated breeders. There will be a page containing information about where people in Ireland go can to 
rescue a dog or support charities.

The deployed site can be viewed [here.](https://ellyc20.github.io/adopt-dont-shop-MS1/index.html)

## UX 

### User Stories 
1. As a user I want to be able to navigate the site easily.
2. As a user I want to be able to contact the campaign organisers if I have a question.
3. As a user I want to be able to find out where I can go to adopt a pet or support a charity.
4. As a user I want to understand what the websites purpose is immediately. 
5. As a user I want to read stories from others who have rescued, to see if it is for me.

### Site Owner 
1. As a site owner I want the information to be clear and informative.
2. As a site owner I want the content to encourage people to support the campaign purpose. 
3. As a site owner I want the website to be easy and straightforward to use. 

### 1. Strategy 
**Project Purpose:**

* To encourage users to consider rescue shelters when looking for a pet.
* To educate people about the dangers of buying dogs from unregulated breeders.
* To promote rescue through the showcasing of other rescue stories. 
* To inform people in Ireland where they can go to rescue a pet. 

### 2. Scope 

* I wanted a simple, straightforward UX experience. 
* I needed what I designed to be within the realms of my current knowledge whilst still being a modern, easy to use website.
* Although fictional, I wanted my content to be clear and concise as though it would be used by real world users. 

### 3. Structure

* A clear layout is in place to ensure users can immediately find what they're looking for. The menu icon used on smaller devices is a well 
recognised icon (hamburger icon) ensuring familiarity. The content is laid out in a way that makes it easy to read and the sections are 
easily distinguished. 
* The Home Page  displays the most information regarding the project and its purpose. It's broken down into small paragraphs making the content 
easy to read for the user.
* The Rescue Stories effectively showcases rescue stories that may encourage others to adopt a pet, these stories are paired with photos for
maximum impact.
* The Rescue Centres page is straight forward and simple to use, users can instinctively visit external websites to gain more information.
* The Contact page was kept very simple allowing users to fill out a form without much complexity. 
* In the Footer users can easily find a contact number, an address and any social media links. 

### 4. Skeleton 

* Wireframes can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/EllyC20/adopt-dont-shop-MS1/tree/master/wireframes/wireframes-ms1)
  
  **When viewing the wireframes you will see that design changes were made throughout the process.**
  * Initially the Homepage was to have three columns of content, however when implementing this the content didn't look or feel right. There was 
    information missing that I felt was crucial to the user stories so instead the Homepage contains more content and displays two columns and then 
    stacks the remaining content. 
  * The Rescue Centres page became more detailed, providing the user with better information. This makes the user experience smoother and overall a better
    way to convey the information. My mentor suggested this change on our initial planning call. 
* Home, Rescue Stories, Rescue Centres and a Contact page. 
* A fixed navbar for all device view.
* A footer with Social Media links, a contact number and an address. This gives people multiple options of contact.

### 5. Surface 

**Colours:** 

I chose font colours and icon colours that I felt complimented the tones of the images on each page. I deliberately stuck to theme of 
warm colours, I felt warm colours would invoke feelings of happiness. 

**Font:** 

The heading font chosen is Montserrat paired with Lora for all body text. I chose the fonts as they paired nicely and I used the article linked
in my acknowledgements to choose fonts that are commonly used. 

**Images:** 
 
All images are related directly to the purpose of the site, this is why photos of animals were chosen. I deliberately chose photos 
where the animals looked relaxed or happy rather than showing them in rescue centres or coming from unpleasant places as I didn't want to evoke 
negative/upsetting emotions for users.

## Features 

### Current Features 

* A four page site navigated using the Nav Bar on large device screens, or a hamburger menu on medium and smaller devices. 
* A page displaying multiple cards containing buttons which allow the user to visit external websites. 
* Social media links are easily accessible in the footer for the user. 
* A fixed Navbar on all screen sizes. 

### Features Left To Be Implemented

* The form needs to be fully functional and know what to do with the data, this will come further into the course.

## Testing

All of the testing details can be found [here.](https://github.com/EllyC20/adopt-dont-shop-MS1/blob/master/TESTING.md) All information regarding Project Barriers and Solutions
is included.

## Deployment

### To Deploy this project, these are the steps taken: 

* All code was written using Gitpod, an online IDE.
* This code was pushed to Github and stored as a repositorie.
* To deploy I chose the repositorie to be deployed, then I entered the settings of this repo. 
* Within settings I scrolled down until I found the section titled "Pages". 
* In this section I selected "Master" as the branch, then saved.
* Once this is saved a link will be shown with the website deployed onto GitHub pages. 
* If you follow this link it will bring you to the deployed website. 

### To Clone: 

* You can run the code locally by cloning or downloading. 
* You click the code button within the repositorie and then select either clone or download. 
* If you clone you will be provided with a url to run in your IDE. 
* If you download, you will be given a zip file.

## Credits
