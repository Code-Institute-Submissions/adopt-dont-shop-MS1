            <h1>About Us <i class="fas fa-paw"></i></h1>
                <p> Adopt Don't Shop was founded in 2018 in an effort to help reduce the number of animals in rescue centres. Our goal is simple, 
                    it is to showcase the stories of rescue dogs and help people in Ireland find out more about where they can rescue animals or support the charities that do. 
                    We've rescued our own fair share of animals over the years, from cats and dogs to turkeys and hens (who all got on very well together!). Our passion for this
                    campaign comes from our love for all animals. We hope that through sharing our passion we can ignite it in others.
                </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 what-we-do">
            <h1>What We Do <i class="fas fa-dog"></i></h1>
                <p> Each month we reach out to our audience through our social media accounts and ask them to share their experiences with their own rescue
                    animals. We then share these stories here on our website so that anyone who might be thinking about rescue can read some first hand experiences
                    of what it is like! We hope these stories will inspire our readers to consider going to an animal shelter before anywhere else when getting a pet. 
                    We've tried to make it easy to find a rescue centre in all parts of Ireland, on our Rescue Centres page you will find information about various centres so 
                    that hopefully, you can find one not too far from you!

                <h1>Why Adopt <i class="fas fa-question"></i></h1>
                    <p> Sadly when dogs come from unregulated breeders or puppy farms, both the puppies and the mother often experience unacceptable conditions where they may 
                        not have enough food, water or shelter. The puppies are usually taken from the mother far too young and the mother will continue to produce litters
                        until she can't anymore. New laws have been introduced in Ireland this year which will help combat the issue, the law now states that it is illegal 
                        to advertise a puppy without its microchip number and without a dog-breeding establishment license. This is a great step forward, however there are still
                        issues. Some licenses issued are very old and conditions may still be unacceptable, once a person has microchipped one dog they then have that microchip 
                        number that they can reuse on their ads repeatedly. This is why it is very hard to know for certain, that you are getting a dog that hasn't been farmed.

                <h1>Benefits Of Rescue <i class="fas fa-question"></i></h1>
                    <p> A lot of the time, rescued animals have had a hard start to their lives. When rescuing you give an animal an opportunity to live a happy life for 
                        their remaining years. Rescuing an animal is a rewarding experience, you feel you have been able to make a difference. You've helped a rescue centre, who
                        will now have more room and resources to rescue further animals in need. However, most importantly you have made a huge difference for your new pet,
                        they will be forever grateful for the opportunity to live a happy, healthy life.
